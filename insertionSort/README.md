# Insertion Sort in C

This repository contains a clear and easy-to-understand implementation of the **Insertion Sort** algorithm written in C. Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm often used for small or nearly sorted datasets.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Written in pure C
- Simple, straightforward algorithm
- In-place sorting with minimal memory usage
- Well-commented code for learning purposes
- Suitable for beginners in data structures and algorithms

## ðŸ“Œ Algorithm Overview

**Insertion Sort** works by:
1. Taking one element at a time from the unsorted portion.
2. Inserting it into the correct position in the sorted portion.
3. Repeating until the entire array is sorted.

**Time Complexity:**
- Worst Case: O(nÂ²)
- Average Case: O(nÂ²)
- Best Case: O(n) (when array is already sorted)

**Space Complexity:** O(1) (in-place sorting)
