ðŸ“ŒDefinition: 

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by comparing each element with those before it and placing it in the correct position.


ðŸ§  How It Works:

Start from the second element (index 1).

Compare it with elements to its left.

Shift elements one position to the right to make space.

Insert the element in the correct position.

Repeat for all elements.


âœ… Time & Space Complexity:

Best Case: O(n) â€“ when array is already sorted

Average & Worst Case: O(nÂ²)

Space: O(1) â€“ in-place

Stable: (does not change relative order of equal elements)
