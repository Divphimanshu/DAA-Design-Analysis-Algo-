📌 Definition:

Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning.


🧠 How It Works:

Start from index 0.

Find the minimum element in the unsorted part.

Swap it with the element at the current index.

Move to the next index and repeat until the array is sorted.


✅ Time & Space Complexity:

Best, Average, Worst: O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(1) – in-place sorting

Stable: ❌ (not stable by default)
