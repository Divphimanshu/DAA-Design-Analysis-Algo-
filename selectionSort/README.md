# Selection Sort in C

This repository contains a straightforward implementation of the **Selection Sort** algorithm written in C. Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm suitable for small datasets and educational purposes.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Implemented in pure C
- Easy to understand and modify
- Step-by-step sorting approach
- Good for learning basic sorting algorithms
- Well-commented code for clarity

## ðŸ“Œ Algorithm Overview

**Selection Sort** works by:
1. Repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array.
2. Swapping it with the first unsorted element.
3. Moving the boundary of the so
