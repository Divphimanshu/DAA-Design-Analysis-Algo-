# Heap Sort in C

This repository contains a clear and efficient implementation of the **Heap Sort** algorithm in C. Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure and is known for its reliable O(n log n) performance.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Implemented in pure C
- Uses a max-heap to sort elements
- In-place sorting with no extra memory needed
- Efficient and consistent O(n log n) time complexity
- Well-commented for easy understanding and learning

## ðŸ“Œ Algorithm Overview

**Heap Sort** works by:
1. Building a max heap from the input data.
2. Repeatedly swapping the root (maximum element) of the heap with the last element.
3. Reducing the heap size by one and heapifying the root.
4. Continuing until the heap size is reduced to one.

**Time Complexity:**
- Worst Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Best Case: O(n log n)

**Space Complexity:** O(1) (in-place sorting)
