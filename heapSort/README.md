ðŸ“Œ Definition:

  Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a Binary Heap data structure (Max-Heap for ascending sort). It divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region and shrinks the unsorted region by    extracting the largest element and moving it to the sorted region.


ðŸ§  How It Works:

Build a Max-Heap from the input data.

Swap the root (maximum element) with the last element.

Reduce the heap size by 1.

Heapify the root again.

Repeat steps 2â€“4 until the heap size becomes 1.


âœ… Time & Space Complexity: 

Time: Best, Average, Worst: O(n log n)

Space: O(1) (in-place)Not Stable
