# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm in C (All-Pairs Shortest Path)

This repository contains a C implementation of the **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** to find the **shortest distances between all pairs of vertices** in a weighted graph (with positive or negative edge weights, but no negative cycles).

---

## üß† Problem Statement

Given a directed graph represented as a matrix, where `graph[i][j]` denotes the weight of the edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j` (or INF if there‚Äôs no direct edge), find the shortest path between every pair of vertices.

## üîç Features

- All-pairs shortest path algorithm
- Uses **Dynamic Programming**
- Handles negative weights (but not negative cycles)
- Compact matrix-based implementation
- Easily modifiable for path reconstruction
