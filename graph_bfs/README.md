# Graph BFS Traversal in C

This repository provides a C language implementation of **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** on a graph using an **adjacency list** representation. The program includes basic graph operations such as adding edges and displaying the graph structure.

## 📌 Overview

- ✅ Graph implementation using **adjacency list**
- ✅ Add undirected edges
- ✅ Display the graph
- ✅ Perform **BFS traversal** from a given source node
- ✅ Queue-based iterative approach

## 🔍 What is BFS?

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is a fundamental graph traversal technique used to explore nodes and edges of a graph. It explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level of neighbors.

**Use cases:**
- Shortest path in unweighted graphs
- Web crawling
- Peer-to-peer networks
- Social network analysis

## 🧠 Algorithm Steps

1. Start from a source node.
2. Visit and mark it as visited.
3. Enqueue the node.
4. Dequeue a node and visit all its unvisited neighbors.
5. Repeat until the queue is empty.
