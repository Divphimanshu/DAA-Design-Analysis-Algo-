# Prim's Algorithm using Greedy Method (C Implementation)

This repository contains a C program that implements **Primâ€™s Algorithm** to find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected, undirected, and weighted graph using the **Greedy method**.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithm Overview

**Primâ€™s Algorithm** starts with a single vertex and greedily adds the smallest edge that connects the growing MST to a new vertex.

### Key Concepts:
- Uses **Greedy strategy** to expand MST step-by-step.
- Selects the minimum weight edge from the set of edges connecting the MST to other vertices.
- Avoids cycles by keeping track of visited vertices.

## ðŸ’» Features

- Uses **Adjacency Matrix** representation.
- Efficient selection of minimum edge using key array.
- Dynamic construction of MST using a parent array.
- Computes and displays total cost of MST.
