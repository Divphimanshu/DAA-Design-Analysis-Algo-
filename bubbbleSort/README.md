# Bubble Sort in C

This repository contains a simple and easy-to-understand implementation of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm written in C. Bubble Sort is one of the most basic sorting algorithms, ideal for educational purposes and understanding sorting fundamentals.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Implemented in pure C
- Simple comparison and swapping based sorting
- Step-by-step sorting process
- Well-commented code for beginners
- Suitable for small datasets and learning basics of sorting

## ðŸ“Œ Algorithm Overview

**Bubble Sort** works by:
1. Repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
2. Passing through the list multiple times until no swaps are needed, meaning the array is sorted.

**Time Complexity:**
- Worst Case: O(nÂ²)
- Average Case: O(nÂ²)
- Best Case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)

**Space Complexity:** O(1) (in-place sorting)
