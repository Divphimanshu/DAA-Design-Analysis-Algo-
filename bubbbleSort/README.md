📌 Definition

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.



🧠 How it Works:

Compare adjacent elements.

Swap if the first is greater than the second.

Repeat the process for all elements.

Largest element “bubbles” to the end in each iteration.



✅ Time & Space Complexity:

Best Case: O(n) – when the array is already sorted

Average & Worst Case: O(n²)

Space: O(1) – in-place sorting
