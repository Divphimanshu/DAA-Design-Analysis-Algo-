# 0/1 Knapsack Problem in C (Dynamic Programming)

This repository provides a C implementation of the classic **0/1 Knapsack Problem** using **Dynamic Programming**. The solution maximizes profit/value without exceeding the knapsack's weight capacity.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Given:
- A set of items, each with a weight and a value.
- A knapsack with a weight limit `W`.

Goal:
- Select a subset of items such that their total weight is â‰¤ `W` and their total value is maximized.

**Note**: You cannot break an item â€” it's either included or excluded (hence 0/1 knapsack).

## ðŸ’» Features

- Efficient **bottom-up DP table** approach.
- Can be extended to show the table for debugging.
- Handles any number of items and capacities.
