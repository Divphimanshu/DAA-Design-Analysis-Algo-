# Merge Sort in C

This repository contains a simple and well-commented implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm in the C programming language. Merge Sort is a classic divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that efficiently sorts an array by recursively dividing it into halves, sorting them, and then merging the sorted halves.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Written in pure C
- Efficient and scalable sorting algorithm
- Works for integer arrays of any size
- Includes detailed comments and explanations
- Suitable for DSA learning and academic projects

## ðŸ“Œ Algorithm Overview

**Merge Sort** works by:
1. Dividing the array into two halves recursively.
2. Sorting each half.
3. Merging the sorted halves to produce a single sorted array.

**Time Complexity:**
- Worst Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Best Case: O(n log n)

**Space Complexity:** O(n) (due to the temporary arrays used for merging)
