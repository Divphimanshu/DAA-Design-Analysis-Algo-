ðŸ“Œ Definition:

Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the two sorted halves.


ðŸ§  How It Works:

Divide the array into two halves.

Recursively sort both halves.

Merge the sorted halves into a single sorted array


âœ… Time & Space Complexity:

Time Complexity:

Best, Average, Worst: O(n log n)

Space Complexity:

O(n) â€“ uses extra space for merging

Stable:  (preserves relative order of equal elements)
